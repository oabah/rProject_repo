This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

##Import libraries
These are the libraries being used in this project

```{r}
library(tm)
library(SnowballC)
library(wordcloud)
library(RColorBrewer) 
library(e1071)         #For Naive Bayes
library(caret)         #For the Confusion Matrix
```

##Import data
The data is then imported aand then columns are specified. The column with cyberbullying words are classified as "Msg"" and whether they are a bullying messages or not, are placed in "Tag".

```{r}
sms_raw <- read.csv("C:\\Users\\Ojoniko Nathan Abah\\Desktop\\bullyingdataset.csv")
sms_raw <- sms_raw[, 2:3]
colnames(sms_raw) <- c("Msg", "Tag")
str(sms_raw)
```

##Find the proportions of junk vs legitimate sms messages
```{r}
table(sms_raw$Tag)
prop.table(table(sms_raw$Tag))
```

Wordclouds are then created, a corpus and dataset are then created.
```{r}
bullyword <- subset(sms_raw, Tag == "Yes")
wordcloud(bullyword$Msg, max.words = 60, colors = brewer.pal(7, "Paired"), random.order = FALSE)


nonbullyword <- subset(sms_raw, Tag == "No")
wordcloud(nonbullyword$Msg, max.words = 60, colors = brewer.pal(7, "Paired"), random.order = FALSE)


sms_corpus <- VCorpus(VectorSource(sms_raw$Msg))

sms_dtm <- DocumentTermMatrix(sms_corpus, control = 
                                list(tolower = TRUE,
                                     removeNumbers = TRUE,
                                     stopwords = TRUE,
                                     removePunctuation = TRUE,
                                     stemming = TRUE))

dim(sms_dtm)

```

##Training & Test set
The data matrix is then divided into two different sets. Ten thousand cases of the data sets are used for training and one thousand cases are used for testing. Labels are also put inplace for training and testing, based on the tags on whether a message or case is a cyberbullying instance or not. A proportion is also put in place for the training and testing sets.

```{r}
sms_dtm_train <- sms_dtm[1:10000, ]
sms_dtm_test <- sms_dtm[10001:11000, ]

sms_train_labels <- sms_raw[1:10000, ]$Tag
sms_test_labels <- sms_raw[10001:11000, ]$Tag

prop.table(table(sms_train_labels))
prop.table(table(sms_test_labels))

threshold <- 0.1

min_freq = round(sms_dtm$nrow*(threshold/100),0)

min_freq
```


##Vector creation and filtering
A vector is then created and the data matrix is then filtered. A function for converting values is then put in place and applied in the train and test sets.
```{r}
freq_words <- findFreqTerms(x = sms_dtm, lowfreq = min_freq)

str(freq_words)

sms_dtm_freq_train <- sms_dtm_train[ , freq_words]
sms_dtm_freq_test <- sms_dtm_test[ , freq_words]

sms_dtm_freq_test <- sms_dtm_test[ , freq_words]

dim(sms_dtm_freq_train)

convert_values <- function(x) {
  x <- ifelse(x > 0, "Yes", "No")
}

sms_train <- apply(sms_dtm_freq_train, MARGIN = 2,
                   convert_values)
sms_test <- apply(sms_dtm_freq_test, MARGIN = 2,
                  convert_values)
```


##Model creation and prediction
A model is then created and predictions are made. The accuracy of the predictions made are then displayed using the confusion matrix. The confusion matrix shows an accuracy of 93.1%.
```{r}
sms_classifier <- naiveBayes(sms_train, sms_train_labels)

sms_test_pred <- predict(sms_classifier, sms_test)

confusionMatrix(data = sms_test_pred, reference = sms_test_labels , positive = "Yes", dnn = c("Prediction", "Actual"))
```
